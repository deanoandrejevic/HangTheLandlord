# User Experience (UX)

The user is incredibly simple and intutive, everything is clearly labeled and it is also accessible for people with disibilites!

 2. I want to be able to play a competent game with little to now gus
 3. I want feedback from the quiz itself, so i know weather i have a question right or wrong!

## Regular User
 1. I want to be able to come back whenever I want and still have a good time and the game evovle. Maybe have new questions added now and then.

 # The scope

 1. I wanted people to have fun with the game.
 2. Wanted it be easy to read and look at with compromising on the looks

 Like my last project I know a lot of people love music and this is a nice little game where they can test thier knowledge. It is a very varied quiz, ranging from 30's jazz all the way up to modern day pop. 

 # Structure

 The structure for the project started out quite massive, but i quickly realised that if i wanted to make something that was competant and stable, I would need to scale back my efforts. I had intitaly planned for the project to be a hang man based game, hence the name, but i shifted gears and wanted to go for a more tradional quiz with a who wants to be a millionaire twist to it. The user has to try and answer 20 questions with out getting any wrong. You get 20 right and you win it is a simple as that but it is harder than meets the eye. The questions are completely randomised and any can come up from the very hard ones to the easy ones at any point. As I was saying before the structure is very easy and simple and should be instantly familer to anyone who has taken part in any quiz or watched one on telly. It is a simple and clean layout with bold colours but not hard on the eyes either.
